Overview
---


Welcome to PeePoo App

This is an app for everybody that some time needs to find a bathroom.
Don't matter if you need to shower your hair or you will go out after work and don't have enought time to go home or if you have an emergency...

The objective of the project was to use all the technologies and knowledge that we have learned.

We wrote the project with **React, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails**. 

We wrote the tables for Amenities, Locations, Bookings and Users then started to do the associations, next was the controllers for create a CRUD. 

Still need some good thinks like, more filters for the search, Login/Logout, everything could be better and better.

## What we have Learned

By the time we submit this project, we covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:

**Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.

**Programming Fundamentals**: Work with server, data base, rubi and rails, use Gems to help to do what we need. Work in a team. Learn how to resolve conficts.

**Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style. Also learn how to do associations with diferent tables in the data base, make a "CRUD" for each one. Make new components with React how conect then.

**Browser Applications**: Dive into Bootstrap use the librarie to get lots of style for free.

**Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment using Heroku.

**Products and Teams**: Document our code and our code repository so others understand what you've built.

### My big Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use our programming skills to build a app
- Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic app that allows people to use in real life

<!-- ###Necessary Deliverables

A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
